   "content": "On the intervening night of February 23/24, 1991 the armed troopers from 4 Rajputana Rifles, 68 Mountain Brigade camped at Trehgam cordoned off the twin villages of Kunan and Poshpora in District Kupwara at around 11:30 pm in the night. During the cordon, the army men dragged out all the men and took them to a kuthar, a makeshift barn, where they were tortured. They were given electric shocks in their body parts, most specifically to their private parts, and water-boarded. Then members of the security forces who had 'turned into beasts' forcefully entered these houses and 'gagged the mouths of the victims and committed forced gang rape against their will and consent'. Even minor girls as young as eight years of age were not spared. More than 35 women irrespective of their age, marital status, pregnancy etc. were gang raped by the army men till 9 am the next day. The victims ranged in the age group of 13-80. Many independent investigations and fact finding missions (including the one led by a former chief justice of the Jammu and Kashmir high court – Justice Bahauddin Farooqi) have concluded that the Kunan Poshpora case has seen unprecedented proportions of ignorance with regards to normal investigative procedures that must be followed after such a crime. Impunity for systematic or isolated sexual violence and brutalities committed by the Indian armed forces, in areas of conflict as Kashmir, is being legitimised by the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). The people of Kashmir have regularly experienced molestation, rape and loot during CASOs.",

Kashmiris, who were booked under these acts, were subjected to third-degree (torture).

Official reports claimed that security forces had, after a gunfight, blown up the hut where the men were hiding, and had retrieved five bodies that had been charred beyond recognition. The bodies were buried separately without any postmortem examination. Following, yet another protest (and massacre at Brakpora - 3 April 2000) on April 6 and 7, the bodies were exhumed and, though badly defaced, were identified by relatives of the five men. The extent of savagery was finally exposed when the first grave revealed a chopped-off nose and chin of a Gujjar who himself was found buried in a separate grave. Dalal’s face had been partly gouged away; he had no bullet marks on him; he may have been burned alive. All the bodies were found to be that of locals. Panchalthan killings represented a botched attempt to pin the blame for Chattisinghpora on the Lashkar-e-Taiba. The controversy over Panchalthan has fuelled allegations that Chattisinghpora was executed by the security establishment in order to defame terrorists.",

On reaching near the LoC, the trio were killed by the soldiers of 4 Rajputana Rifles in a fake encounter, dubbing them as Pakistani militants. The next day, the army claimed it had foiled an infiltration bid on the LoC near Kupwara by killing three militants. It also claimed it had recovered five AK rifles, a large cache of ammunition and Pakistani currency from their possession.The army claimed it had killed three young men in an encounter with Pakistani militants. In the meantime, back home, the sudden disappearance of the youth, who lived in three different mohallas of Nadihal, led the families to file missing reports with the police after days of unsuccessful search. Further investigation by the local police investigation led to the unravelling of the Army fake encounter story and discovery of the bodies. The bodies of Riyaz Ahmad Lone, 20, Shahzad Ahmed Khan, 27, and Mohammad Shafi Lone,19, were found in the Machil area of Kupwara district. Shahzad pushed a cart in the Baramulla market and was married with a young son. Shafi had studied till Class 6 and then become a labourer. Riyaz had never been to school. He worked as a mechanic at a workshop in Sangrama, also in Baramulla district, and made Rs 50 a day, according to his father. All three were from Nadihal. According to police reports, they were killed sometime on April 30, 2010, and buried as foreign militants.",

Mattoo died on the spot as the shell broke his skull. His death catalyzes intense new protests that last months. Indian forces impose a curfew and kill more than 100 young Kashmiris during protests that en-sued. The brutality ignited passions across Kashmir, triggering a deadly cycle of protests and retaliatory killings by government forces. That’s when the new, intifada-like uprising for the right to self-determination began, for the generation that grew up under the militarized rule, and when the words Go India, Go Back and We Want Freedom began to appear on the lanes and shuttered shops all over the region.",

Under duress, many of these detainees were pressurized to confess to committing a crime they were not involved in.
